## Hi, I'm Frankie 👋

👨‍💻 I am a rising junior at Duke University studying Computer Science and Statistics.

🌱 I'm interested in exploring the intersections of data science/machine learning and human-centered causes through research.

📊 I’m looking to collaborate on data science/machine learning projects, but am open to tasks related to other CS fields such as app development

## More about my experience

📍 I'm currently working at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in the Artificial Intelligence Group under [Computer Vision Researcher Derek Rollend](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PIyTOkkAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on using segmentation models to provide city-level emissions estimates of the transportation sector as part of the [Climate TRACE](https://www.climatetrace.org/) coalition. 

🔭 For the last year, I performed [computer vision research](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/creating-artificial-worlds-ai-improve-energy-access-data-2021-2022) under Duke professor [Dr. Kyle Bradbury](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/kyle-bradbury), exploring the benefit of synthetic imagery (using the GP-GAN) for domain adaptation on an object detection of energy infrastructure in satellite imagery. 

🔗 My aforementioned research from this past summer can be found at [this link](https://frankwillard.github.io/AIforArtificialWorlds/). The public repos for this year's work can be found at [@Duke-BC-2021-AI-for-energy-access](https://github.com/Duke-BC-2021-AI-for-energy-access).
