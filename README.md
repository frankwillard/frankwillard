### Hi, I'm Frankie 👋

👨‍💻 I am a sophomore at Duke University studying Computer Science and Statistics.

👀 I'm interested in exploring the intersections of data science and human-centered causes through research.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects, but am open to tasks related to other CS fields such as application development

🔭 I’m currently performing [computer vision research](https://bassconnections.duke.edu/project-teams/creating-artificial-worlds-ai-improve-energy-access-data-2021-2022) under Duke professor [Dr. Kyle Bradbury](https://ece.duke.edu/faculty/kyle-bradbury), exploring the benefit of synthetic satellite imagery (using the GP-GAN) for domain adaptation on an object detection task. 

🔗 My aforementioned research from this past summer can be found at [this link](https://frankwillard.github.io/AIforArtificialWorlds/).  The repos for our summer work can be found at [@Duke-DP-Artificial-Worlds-with-AI](https://github.com/Duke-DP-Artificial-Worlds-with-AI) and this year's work can be found at [@Duke-BC-2021-AI-for-energy-access](https://github.com/Duke-BC-2021-AI-for-energy-access).
