### Hi, I'm Frankie 👋

👨‍💻 I am a sophomore at Duke University studying Computer Science and Statistics.

👀 I'm interested in exploring the intersections of data science and human-centered causes through research.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on data science projects, but am also interested in exploring application development and other fields of computer science

🔭 I’m currently working on a Duke Bass Connections Research Team under Dr. Kyle Bradbury, exploring the benefit of synthetic satellite imagery (using the GP-GAN) for domain adaptation.
